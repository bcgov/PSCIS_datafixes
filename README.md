# PSCIS datafixes

Tracking and fixing data issues in the BC Provincial Stream Crossing Information System (PSCIS)

[User guide](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/forests-for-tomorrow/pscis-user-guide-v2.pdf)

PSCIS layers available through DataBC Catalogue:

- [Assessments](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/pscis-assessments)
- [Confirmations](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/pscis-habitat-confirmations)
- [Designs](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/pscis-design-proposal)
- [Remediations](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/pscis-remediation)


## Workflow

- open issues in this repo for quickly logging a PSCIS data error (and noting proposed fix if apparent)
- generate code to apply fixes (todo)

Note that fix scripts need to reflect the operational `PSCIS` database and must be tested against a copy of this db (internal to @bcgov) for validity.
